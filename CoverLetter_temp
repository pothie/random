Dear Hiring Manager,

I would like to take this opportunity to express my interest in the POS position available at Company. With four-year programming experience and a solid quantitative background, I am sure that I will be an enviable asset at Company.

As a programmer, I first familiarized myself with Java and C/C++ in academic studies and self-learned Python, HTML, JavaScript and SQL during my internship. The Erdos Institute Python bootcamp and a series of R classes have enhanced my skills in data analysis and machine learning.

As a mathematician, I have developed problem-solving and analytical-thinking abilities during my six-year study in theoretical analysis and numerical computation. My graduate thesis and all statistics classes have trained me in interpreting numerical solutions to practical results. Over the course of my teaching career and work, I have also become excelled in explaining mathematical concepts to non-technical audience with different backgrounds.

I hope to bring my astute problem-solving skills, knack for programming and passion for data to Company. I appreciate your time and consideration, and I look forward to discussing this position further with you in the future.



Sincerely,

Yidi Chen
